# Course overview

The [introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf) helps installing R or RStudio and should give some broad understanding of the programming concepts, including the use and implementation of your own custom functions. In the exercises of this course you'll get to know R better and write your own \(recursive\) functions.

This course puts programming code in a grey box. You can copy \(use the top right button\) and paste it directly into the R console.

```r
# Did you find the copy shortcut?
1 + 2 * 3 == 9
```

Pasting this in R should result in `FALSE`.

If the copying doesn't work under Internet Explorer, please use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).
